## Project Description

 * As a group, we believed this project would be interesting because we all grew up playing video games. We believed it would be fun to recreate the nostalgia of popular games we played such as Oregon trail, Pokemon and other RPG games through coding. This project also seems important for our future projects/endeavors, serving as an introduction into game design. 
 * For the coding language we will be using C++. We will also be using Github to distribute our game. We might include a file saving system through the use of Json file structure. The main means of communication between the user and the system will be through the terminal screen. 
 * For input/output, users will be able to input their choice of action through text in the terminal. All the outputs will be visible to the users through the terminal screen in a form of text feedback. 
 * For features, we will create a text-based RPG game featuring characters equipped with different roles and customizable actions and attributes. 
    * These roles include characters such as Warriors, Mages and more. 
    * Players can personalize their characters by changing their attributes and traits through stats points, earned via the leveling combat system. Within our system, users can choose actions displayed on the terminal, like fighting, running away, or changing equipment. 
    * Character progression involves a combat system where battles with other non-playable characters allows to gain experience points to level up. We will introduce bosses and a narrative for the user characters for an immersive experience.

 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
